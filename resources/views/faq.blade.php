It is not the total learning time so you also need to allow time for self-study such as reading and research.  Whether you are studying privately or through a study centre you will need to allow both the guided learning hours plus additional self-study time in order to successfully complete the qualification.

The credits you achieve through some qualifications may count towards others, if you have covered similar learning outcomes at a comparable level. As a general rule, ten hours of learning (including both taught and self-study) equates to approximately one credit.
