                            I would recommend anyone with a passion for higher learning to explore the opportunities available with ABE UK.  With a dash of ambition, a few drops of discipline and time management you can achieve whatever goals you set for yourself.

                            ABE has now become well-known in Myanmar and I notice that recent successful organisations recognise ABE graduates for job application purposes. This is because most top level managers themselves hold ABE qualifications. I also believe ABE qualifications have nurtured and developed those successful business entrepreneurs to be who they are now.

                           When I reflect on my 4 years with the Association of Business Executives (ABE), I conclude the association has had major impact on my career development.

                            My studies equipped me with vital knowledge on various theories such as organisational behaviour and structure my creative approach to problem solving and also improved my decision making .
                            These are transferrable skills that I use in my current role as Mayor of Royal borough of Greenwich.  ABE have provided the fundamental knowledge and skill that underpin this great honour.

                           I have no doubt that ABE graduates are better prepared for the job market which is why my foundation gives ABE qualification holders priority in employment and this has led to all but one of our staff members/consultants being ABE Alumni.

                           I opted for ABE, among a myriad of other options, as the programme offers the right mix of modules at an affordable cost and flexible timing so I could achieve a work, life and study balance.
